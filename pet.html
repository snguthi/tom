        <h1>My pet cat</h1>
        <p>I was sitted on my front potch smoking when it walked up and stared into my eyes like it was back. It felt like it belonged and made me feel like I was being a snob by not welcoming the now wet and shaking cat</p>

        <h2>Tom</h2>
        <p>Looking into it's eyes, I could not help but notice the striking resemblance between Tom from Tom&Jerry and the shaking street cat infront of me. I had found a name for the creature infront of me incase I would adopt it.</p>
